# Our place for _everything digitial_: Welcome to the Unione Sportiva Asiago's Digital Team page! 👋
Hey there! We are the team behind the website and the Design System of the Unione Sportiva Asiago, an italian ski team with a centenary story at its back, but with a big craving to change the way we use the web to communicate our story (and our goals too!).

Our goal is to create something big, beautifully appealing and easy to use for everyone (and by _everyone_ we mean _EVERYONE_), and that's why we decided to publish as an Open-Source project our Design System. 🎨

## Us + you = ❤️
We're better together! If you want to help us shape the future of our website, head over to the `Design-System` repository and take a look at what we've done.
In case you notice something wrong, create an `Issue` or just leave a comment in our Figma files. 😃

We are committed to accessibility: issues regarding this topic are warmly accepted.

## Need help? We're here 👦
